# Music info

## Overview

Music info is a simple CRUD web application used for looking up basic information about music albums. Then you can log what album you heard and when you heard it (for statistic purpose). Sometimes the information (such as release date or no. tracks) from external APIs may be lacking or incorrect, you can edit these yourself with ease when logging.  

This is a hobby project I started to learn and try out new technologies such as Docker, Gunicorn, Nginx. The project contains both docker compose files for development and production. The latter uses Gunicorn as a WSGI production level server and Nginx to serve the static files (HTML, CSS, JS).
